- Each time the user uploads a media they can add details such as who took the photo or video, the location, the time, and text explaining the reason for the media.
- Security features to restrict access to specific people
- 
  
## Goals
- Enable easy uploading and organizing of digital files
- Support tagging, metadata extraction, and categorization
- Provide privacy controls for sensitive documents
- Build a system usable on a home computer without complex setup

## Progress Plan
- Week 1–2: Domain understanding, technology selection  
- Week 3–4: Set up GitHub repo, build initial database schema  
- Week 5–6: Develop GUI prototypes for file upload and browsing  
- Week 7–8: Implement metadata tagging and privacy features
