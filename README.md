# Family Documentation Organizer

## Project Description
A software application that gives families a chance to document, organize, and preserve their digital history (photos, videos, documents, more). We will provide two GUIs, a database backend, and tools for tagging and managing content intuitively.

## Technologies
- Python (backend logic + automation)
- SQLite (local database storage)
- Tkinter (user-friendly GUI)

## Goals
- Enable easy uploading and organizing of digital files
- Support tagging, metadata extraction, and categorization
- Provide privacy controls for sensitive documents
- Build a system usable on a home computer without complex setup

## Progress Plan
- Week 1–2: Domain understanding, technology selection  
- Week 3–4: Set up GitHub repo, build initial database schema  
- Week 5–6: Develop GUI prototypes for file upload and browsing  
- Week 7–8: Implement metadata tagging and privacy features  
- Week 9–10: Testing, refinement, and client feedback
