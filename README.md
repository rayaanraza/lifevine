# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Description
A software application that gives families an opportunity to document, organize, and preserve their digital history such as their photos, videos, and documents. This application will have two GUIs, a database, and a program to organize and document this information in chronological order. Families often face challenges locating this information because it is scattered across different locations and difficult to access. The app will arrange all media on a timeline, allow families to share selected content with each other, provide options to sort by videos, photos, or documents, and include security features to restrict access to specific people. For each item, the user will be listed and will have the option to add details such as who took the photo or video, the location, the time, and text explaining the reason for the media.  

## Technologies 
- React - used for the graphical user interface
- Firebase- for authentication and secure login
- SQL - used for managing the database

## Tools
- GitHub- location of our source code and the platform for our team to collaborate
- Figma- GUI design
- Visual Studio Code - IDE for coding

## Features
- Timeline (chronological order)
- Dropdown menu for user selection (photos, videos, and documents)
- Each time the user uploads a media they can add details such as who took the photo or video, the location, the time, and text explaining the reason for the media
- Security features to restrict access to specific people
- Searching tool to look up key words and find the photo, video, or document
  
## Goals
- Create a platform that is functional and creates an experience for the users
- A secure and safe application where users have their own account
- Users have the option to restrict access to certain content
- Users will have the ability to organize their media based on preference and share it with their families

## Progress Plan
- Week 1: Meet with our mentor, create a plan for the project, and present our goals to the class.
- Week 2: Meet with our mentor, Set up Github repo, create two unit tests, and complete the README file documentation.
- Week 3-4: Create the login page and registration page. 
- Week 5-6: Meet with our mentor and build the initial database 
- Week 7-8: Continue to work on the database, and create a GUI for file upload   
- Week 9-10: Meet with our mentor, continue to work on the features, and implement privacy features for restrictions
- Week 11: Add features such as search tab and a dropdown for sorting
- Week 12: Meet with our mentor, run tests, and work on the features
- Week 13-15: Incorporate final feedback from our mentor into the app and fix any bugs
- Week 16: Present the final application to Dr. Mansoor Abdulhak, our mentor, and the TA.
