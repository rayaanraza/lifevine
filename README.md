## Project Description
A software application that gives families an opportunity to document, organize, and preserve their digital history such as their photos, videos, and documents. This application will have two GUIs, a database, and a program to organize and document this information in chronological order. Families often face challenges locating this information because it is scattered across different locations and difficult to access. The app will arrange all media on a timeline, allow families to share selected content with each other, provide options to sort by videos, photos, or documents, and include security features to restrict access to specific people. For each item, the user will be listed and will have the option to add details such as who took the photo or video, the location, the time, and text explaining the reason for the media.  

## Technologies 
- React - used for the graphical user interface
- Firebase- for authentication and secure login
- SQL - used for managing the database

## Tools
- GitHub- location of our source code and the platform for our team to collaborate
- Figma- GUI design
- Visual Studio Code - IDE for coding

## Features
- Timeline (chronological order)
- Dropdown menu for user selection (photos, videos, and documents)
- Each time the user uploads a media they can add details such as who took the photo or video, the location, the time, and text explaining the reason for the media
- Security features to restrict access to specific people
- Searching tool to look up key words and find the photo, video, or document
  
## Goals
- Create a platform that is functional and creates an experience for the users
- A secure and safe application where users have their own account
- Users have the option to restrict access to certain content
- Users will have the ability to organize their media based on preference and share it with their families

## Progress Plan

- Week 3-4: Create the login page and registration page. 
- Week 5-6: Meet with our mentor and build the initial database 
- Week 7-8: Continue to work on the database, and create a GUI for file upload   
- Week 9-10: Meet with our mentor, continue to work on the features, and implement privacy features for restrictions
- Week 11: Add features such as search tab and a dropdown for sorting
- Week 12: Meet with our mentor, run tests, and work on the features
- Week 13-15: Incorporate final feedback from our mentor into the app and fix any bugs
